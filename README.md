## Additional Comments

### I also felt my about me page does not need a picture of me. If an employer wanted to see what I looked like they can view my Github page or Linkedin page. If this was required to prove I can manipulate an image with css, then I should have met the requirements with the flexbox and "Work" section of this challenge. Not to mention the hero section. I personal didn't have any pictures of myself the complimented the blue background and were appealing.
